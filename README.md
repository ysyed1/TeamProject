# TeamProject
OIM3640 Term Project Proposal
Yusra Syed, Saanya Jhaveri, Faija Choudhury

# 1. The Big Idea

The main idea of this project is to create a database for restaurants in the Greater Boston area - including sorting tools so that we can help people find restaurants tailored to what they are looking for (cuisines, location, time and vibe - the vibe element will implicitly include our subjective points of view as local college students frequently visiting highly rated spots which we predict is useful for users) 

We will explore different ways to implement this project. The minimum viable product will be python code that allows for user inputs. The stretch goal is a website that has an easy to use interface that users can use to tailor their restaurant recommendations. A stretch even beyond that is to be able to partner with restaurants to show reservation availability. We think that this will have a positive impact because while there are reservation booking websites right now, there arenâ€™t specific ones that tailor recommendations and then give you reservation times based on the filters they choose. 

The way we plan to do this is to create a database and utilize various python functions like if statements to sort out data and list functions and methods to order the data appropriately. 

# 2. Learning Goals

When meeting as a group to complete this assignment, we shared with eachother what we expected to take from this class and project experience. 

Faija: By applying what we have learned in class, I will be able to see how I can use these skills in the future or for different programs. Through the project, I will be able to understand how to code more efficiently and fix errors quickly. Working with teams will help us understand each other's code and use the feedback to improve.

Saanya: I want to utilize at least 50% of what we have learned so far as well as 2-3 new functions/methods we have not used so far to create the restaurant guide. I want to deepen my understanding of how to use Python more broadly. Creating a guide that can be helpful for people when they do not know where to eat and making the interface as simple and easy to use as possible are also learning goals of mine.

Yusra: The technical skill of being proficient in Python is a personal goal of mine in order to better myself in the Marketing and Information Technology Management field, no matter the role. I have struggled with some exercises and questions in the past month of OIM3640, yet I feel more confident when applying the basic methodologies (if statements, while loop, lists) to the larger problem. At the end of this project, I hope to get to the point of being able to code in a logical way based on what output I want to see, without immediately feeling overwhelmed by looking at the question. I have had great team dynamics in my Babson experience since junior year for Strategic Management, Management Consulting Field Experience, and Communicating Consumer Behavior Change - I want to add this class to the list! When a team works well, I feel as though the project is successful for far more reasons than just correctness of the deliverable or letter grade.

Our shared goal is to create a database to make it easier and efficient for users to find the dining locations that best suit their preferences. Launching a project that we are all passionate about and can help fellow Boston foodies encourages us to work towards this idea as much as possible. We plan to priortize a successful team dynamic in which we (a) achieve our desired result (b) complete our individual learning goals (c) would work together again. 

# 3. Implementation Plan

For this project, we need to find the listing of the restaurants in the greater Boston Area. As Boston's food scene is constantly evolving, there will be restaurants that we will not have the oppurtunity or time to visit. We plan to gather that information from another trustworthy website, like Yelp, Beli, and other food and restaurant rating platforms. 

We also intend to use the tags on Instagram that people use when they go out to eat. Those posts will give us pictures of the restaurant interior, menu items, and more to include in our website while also providing us insight about customers' experiences at the restaurant (also referred to as "social listening" in Marketing and Digital Analytics). The location of the users and their desired input in the filter will also help in finding the result that will best fit their needs. 

# 4. Project Schedule

We have figured out a preliminary timeline that will be adjusted as we move further into the project. We have decided to split the work by weeks based on the assignments and the deadline.

*Week 1, 2 and 3: Design and Code Review*
		During Week 1 and 2, we plan to start working on the design of our project. In the time frame, we will go through many changes as we explore the possibilities and what design works best for our audience (considering user experience). We will begin our coding process, relying on pseudo code to guide our website design. As we test various designs, we will distribute sub-taks within the overarching task to team members. We anticipate coding will take most of our time in the project timeline. We need to start with the basics in order to maintain organization and prevent errors as we go deeper in our project.

*Week 4:  Mid Project Presentation*
		Our goal for the mid project presentation is to have a final draft of the code and design. We plan to complete the coding by the time and use the rest of the time to change and update based on the feedback of our classmates.  

*Week 5, 6 and 7 : Project Website*
	    We will work on building the website, including our accomplishments throughout the project and creating a portfolio documenting the other deliveries completed during the project. While we work on the website, we will also update the code and our project.

*Week 8: Code Submission*
	    We plan to get all of our work done by the end of week 7. We have learned through past exercises and Assignment 1 that leaving code to the last minute is a bad habit and often does not result in our best work. Therefore, the last week will be for any last minute changes or problems that we might face.

# 5. Collaboration Plan

We plan to distribute workload into sub-tasks depending on the deliverables and tasks of the week. Based on our individual interests, we will discuss, pick, and/or share what we feel most strongly about working on. If one of us is experienced in a specific culture and cuisine, they will have the chance to lead the research of the Boston restaurants featuring that food. This will make the project more engaging for each of us throughout. Though there is some individual work involved, meeting together to discuss our progress, ask for help, or pair program is encouraged. Pair programming is ideal, yet unrealistic with our conflicting schedules and off- and on-campus living arrangements. We will be setting a once a week meeting time to keep track of our project timeline (TBD), most probably after class on Tuesday for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

To communicate, we use a text message group for meeting scheduling, project suggestions, and clarifying questions. Email, Slack, and Google Workspace are used for longer deliverables and shared work, with comments and chat used for feedback and live discussion. We are familiar with these tools and they have proven successful for past group projects. If need be, Yusra has experience with Trello for agile experimentation and product development, yet familiarizing oneself with a new tool is an additional challenge to the project. We will weigh the pros and cons if we find our plan and process needs improvement in the future. 

# 6. Risks

There are a range of different risks that may affect the success of this project. First, the python expertise required for the project might just be too much for us where we find ourselves really struggling. In this case, we can bring the project down to a more bare version of itself (maybe just python code that a user interacts with). On the other hand, the project might be too simple where we are not meeting our individual goals of broadening and deepening our knowledge of python. In this case, we can maximize the scope of the project by making our final product more thorough and detailed, either simplifying/focusing the database OR adding more complexities to our existing plan. 

Another risk is that we do not communicate well as a team - we have idea differences and various levels of input to the project or fail to respond to other's ideas and suggestions in a timely, thoughtful manner. We will try to make sure that work is divided evenly and hold each other accountable by discussing upcoming deliverables and tasks well in advance. By prioritizing communication, we will brainstorm ideas and decisions as democratically as possible, treating our conversations as a dicussion or think-tank.

# Past Ideas

Educational Technology - Quizlet allows for student to practice and learn terminology for their classes, providing them with a learning style best for them, finding a way to help Babson students learn in their own way and pace through our solution
(1) we are considering any solution that would help students to learn specifically a word bank or fill in the blank game on a website, allowing students to input their vocabulary or terms 

Learning New Language and Culture - teaching peers, friends, and family through our solution in a fun way on a new language's vocabulary and cultural facts
(2) users may prompt a certain keyword relating to a country or culture or language, triggering other actions that relate to the terms (ex_ fun facts, geography or map graphic locations 

TV Show/Movie/Book Catalog - data cloud, creating an organized database or website to rank our favorite media - very useful tool amongst college students!
(3) TV show/movie/book catalog can incorporate elements of digital analytics such as TV show/movie/book ratings, reviews, and recommendations based on keywords or search terms user inputs. What about creating a survey to share with our personal networks for catalog recommendations? We can then use that data for our project or static website.
